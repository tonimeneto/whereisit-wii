# WhereIsIt (Wii)

**WhereIsIt (Wii)** is a system designed to reliably locate and identify files across local and cloud storage — **before** any AI-powered questioning.

This project exists to answer a very specific and fundamental question:

> **Where is it?**

Only after that question is answered with confidence does it make sense to ask anything else.

## Philosophy

Most modern tools start by asking questions and generating answers.

Wii does the opposite.

1. **Find the file**
2. **Identify what it really is**
3. **Trust the result**
4. **Only then, ask questions**

AI is a *layer*, not the foundation.

## What Wii Is

- A reliable file locator
- A system focused on identification, not speculation
- A foundation for knowledge work built on real files
- Designed to work with local and cloud storage
- Metadata-first by design

---

## What Wii Is NOT

- Not a chat-first system
- Not a hallucination engine
- Not an “ask anything” AI
- Not dependent on embeddings or RAG to function
- Not optimized for answering before finding

---

## Core Principles

- **Reality first**: files exist independently of AI
- **Metadata over magic**: good metadata beats clever prompts
- **Deterministic before semantic**
- **No guessing allowed**
- **AI must never hide uncertainty**

---

## Architecture Direction (High-Level)

- File ingestion and indexing
- Metadata extraction and normalization
- Deterministic search and filtering
- Optional semantic layers (later, never mandatory)
- Questioning and reasoning only after confirmation

---

## Status

This repository starts intentionally minimal.

The goal is to build a solid, auditable foundation before adding:
- semantic search
- embeddings
- RAG
- external AI connectors

## Guiding Question

> **Find first.  
> Ask later.**
